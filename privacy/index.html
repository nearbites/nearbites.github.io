          </ul>
          <p>We may also collect personal information from third parties including third party companies such as law enforcement agencies and other government entities, e-commerce platforms, data suppliers, advertisers, mailing lists and contractors and business partners.</p>

If we sell the business and the sale is structured as a share sale, you acknowledge that this transaction will not constitute the 'transfer' of personal information.</p>
          <p><strong>4.3</strong> We may collect and disclose personal information to third parties for the purposes described in this Policy. These third parties and purposes include but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul>

            <li><p>to our related entities, employees, officers, agents, contractors, other companies that provide services to us, sponsors, government agencies or other third parties to satisfy the purposes for which the information was collected or for another purpose if that other purpose is closely related to the primary purpose of collection and an individual would reasonably expect us to disclose the information for that secondary purpose;</p></li>
            <li><p>to third parties including those in the food, drink, leisure, marketing and advertising sectors, to use your information in order to let you know about goods and services which may be of interest to you in accordance with the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) and the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth);</p></li>

            <li><p>to any other person, with your consent (express or implied);</p></li>
            <li><p>to a government agency if disclosure is required by a law or legal process;</p></li>

            <li><p>to third parties to facilitate the sale of our all or a substantial part of our assets or business or to companies with which we propose to merge or who propose to acquire us and their advisers.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the above recipients, we will disclose your personal information if the disclosure is made in connection with the normal operation of our business in a way that you might reasonably expect, for example, if such disclosure is incidental to IT services being provided to our business, efficient communications between you and us, for the secure storage and management of your files to allow us to provide you proper access to the Website or the App, or for the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and us.</p>

If you make an access request, we will ask you to verify your identity. There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.

          <p><strong>10.4</strong> Where such information is not wholly linked to your identity, we may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal information) relating to your activity on our website (including IP addresses) via cookies.
